Hack-A-Web
- A contest by NITB
- Working Code of Statement 4: ED-Tech (VIRTUAL PLACEMENT CELLS) will be found on this repo.
- Getting a good job opportunity for students is difficult but is currently being solved by many platforms on the internet.
There is no such platform to connect Training and Placement cells of colleges with the companies who want to hire
students from colleges. The current scenario looks like all colleges post their placement status on LinkedIn for marketing 
their T&P cell and try reaching the companies.
- So, the task is to create a prototype that will connect all T&P cells of colleges to companies that want to hire.
- Mandatory Features include • T&P cells can showcase their profiles to the companies.
• Companies can post the status for hiring purposes.
• Companies can list all hiring details in their profile.
• Include all important features required for collaboration among T&P cells and companies seamlessly.
